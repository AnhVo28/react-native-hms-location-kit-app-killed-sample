## React Native: Running services continuously when app is in the background or killed state in React Native


## Introduction
Location Kit combines the GNSS, Wi-Fi, and base station location functionalities into your app to build up global positioning capabilities, allowing you to provide flexible location-based services for global users. Currently, it provides three main capabilities: fused location, activity identification, and geofence.

This demo project will focus on creating current location update and activity identification that are running background, foreground and when the app is killed.
